        <h2>Mark Keifer Watson</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Mark Keifer Watson, portrayed by Andres Muhlach, is the strict, hot-headed, and fiercely protective president of Section E, the notorious all-boys section known for its unruly behavior. As the self-appointed leader, Keifer values loyalty, order (in their own chaotic way), and keeping outsiders away.

            Beneath his gruff and intimidating personality, Keifer hides a deep sense of responsibility for his classmates, treating them like brothers. His tough exterior masks his insecurities about change and vulnerability, especially when a female transfer student, Jay-jay, disrupts their male-dominated section.
            
            Keifer starts off as cold, dismissive, and antagonistic, but over time, his guard slowly lowers, revealing his softer side, hidden fears, and capacity for care and affection. His journey is one of growth, acceptance, and learning to confront emotions heâ€™s always buried under his tough facade.
