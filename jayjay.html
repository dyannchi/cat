            <h2>Jasper Jean Mariano</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Jasper Jean "Jay-jay" Mariano, played by Ashtine Olviga, is the bold, outspoken, and determined female transfer student who unexpectedly becomes the first and only girl in Section E. Despite the section's notorious reputation for chaos and their strong resistance to outsiders, Jay-jay refuses to be intimidated and stands her ground.

Jay-jay is independent and confident, with a strong sense of justice. Her arrival challenges the "all-boys" dynamic of Section E, shaking up their routines and challenging the authority of their president, Mark Keifer Watson. Her presence brings both tension and unexpected moments of vulnerability from the boys, especially Keifer.

As the series progresses, Jay-jayâ€™s resilience and hidden warmth gradually earn her the respect (and affection) of her classmates. She becomes not only a catalyst for change within Section E but also a key figure in helping Keifer confront his own emotional walls.
