            <h2>Yuri Hanamitchi</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Yuri, portrayed by Rabin Angeles, is the charming, playful, and often mischievous member of Section E. Known as the group's natural flirt and joker, Yuri loves teasing his classmates and even their teachers — especially after Jay-jay arrives, becoming one of the first to welcome her with his signature humor and carefree personality.

                Despite his clownish exterior, Yuri is fiercely loyal to his Section E brothers and often acts as the bridge between Keifer’s strict leadership and the rest of the class. He has a knack for diffusing tension with jokes but also knows when to step up and support his friends when things get serious.
                
                Yuri’s character adds comic relief to the series, but his moments of sincerity reveal that beneath his antics is someone who values friendship, loyalty, and staying true to the Section E bond.
